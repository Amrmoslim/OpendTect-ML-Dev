## Challenge July 2021: ML Fault Prediction Challenge

Here you can download the pdf that explains the ML Fault Prediction Challenge, the Delft dataset and become member of the OpendTect Machine Learning Developmers' Community on Discord.

Please be informed that we have suspended the ML Fault Prediction Challenge because the Delft data set is not the best possible data set for this particular challenge. We have selected another data set and are preparing this one for a restart of the ML Fault Prediction Challenge in the near future. Please stay tuned for more information and sorry for the inconvenience.
