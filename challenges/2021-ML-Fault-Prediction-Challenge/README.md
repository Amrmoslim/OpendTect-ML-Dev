## Challenge July 2021: ML Fault Prediction Challenge

Here you can download the pdf that explains the ML Fault Prediction Challenge, the Delft dataset and become member of the OpendTect Machine Learning Developmers' Community on Discord.

### How to start?

- Download the [Delft ML fault challenge pdf-file](https://github.com/OpendTect/OpendTect-ML-Dev/blob/main/challenges/2021-ML-Fault-Prediction-Challenge/Delft_ML_fault_challenge.pdf)
- Download the free [Delft dataset](https://terranubis.com/datainfo/Delft) from TerraNubis. From OpendTect 6.6.4 and onwards this dataset does not check for license keys, hence can be used for free Machine Learning experiments.
- Xingmin Wu's 3D synthetic seismic examples (128x128x128) with fault masks can be downloaded from https://github.com/xinwucwp/faultSeg (with a bit of manipulations 
you can also use these examples for training a 2D model)
- join the [OpendTect Machine Learning Developers' Community on Discord](https://discord.gg/9cVrW2sNza) where you can ask questions and get access to the ML knowledge base. Please note that you have to join the OMLD Community on Discord if you want to participate.
