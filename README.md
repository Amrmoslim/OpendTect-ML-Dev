## Getting started

To get started with Machine Learning in OpendTect several datasets are provided on TerraNubis with which all plugins are available for all users.
There is ofcourse [F3 offshore the Netherlands](https://terranubis.com/datainfo/F3-Demo-2020) and [Penobscot](https://terranubis.com/datainfo/Penobscot).
Recently two more sets were added in support of the FORCE competition, they can be found on [TerraNubis](https://terranubis.com/)

Follow the steps below to install OpendTect 6.6 and download the complete datasets.

- Step 1: Download the [installer for OpendTect 6.6](https://dgbes.com/index.php/download)
- Step 2: Download the [free datasets](https://terranubis.com/datalist/free) on [TerraNubis](https://terranubis.com/)

Videos:

- [Watch the Machine Learing Webinar series](https://videos.opendtect.org/#machinelearningwebinars)

   These will show the steps needed to make and train your own models, shows you the workflows, goes over some of the basics and theory.
