## Webinar 2021-04-29: How to prepare well logs to get optimal Machine Learning results

Here you can download the Jupyter Notebook and images used in the webinar of 29nd of April 2021 by FORCE 2020 Machine Learning winner Olawale Ibrahim.

The webinar example and code notebook show how well logs could be prepared for machine learning predictions from an OpendTect environment. The data copy used in the webinar is currently publicly unavailable, hence notebook codes will need to be remodified for individual use cases.

Getting the best set of training data (wells and logs) is essential for getting best lithology prediction results from Machine Learning models. With database access to a large number of available wells for doing this in OpendTect, manually visualizing and exploring this big data set of wells could be time consuming and also lead to less optimal performance. In this webinar, we showed methods to extract the best set of training well data while also getting optimal prediction performance.
